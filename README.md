# AI-Open-Library
A structured, open-access knowledge archive for learning and researching Artificial Intelligence, with a focus on world models, embodied AI, and agent-based systems.

## Purpose
This repository serves as a comprehensive knowledge archive for AI researchers, students, and practitioners. It provides organized access to papers, tutorials, code examples, and resources covering the most important areas of artificial intelligence research and development.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into 11 specialized knowledge domains:

- **00_World_Models_and_Embodied_AI** - Research on world models, embodied AI, and agent-environment interaction
- **01_Deep_Learning** - Core deep learning architectures, techniques, and applications
- **02_Reinforcement_Learning** - RL algorithms, environments, and theoretical foundations
- **03_Multi_Agent_Learning** - Multi-agent systems, coordination, and emergent behaviors
- **04_AI_Foundations** - Mathematical foundations, theory, and fundamental concepts
- **05_LLMs_and_Transformers** - Large language models, transformer architectures, and NLP
- **06_Training_Dynamics_and_Generalization** - Optimization, generalization theory, and training methodologies
- **07_AI_Ethics_and_Society** - AI safety, ethics, fairness, and societal impact
- **08_Research_Writing_and_Publishing** - Academic writing, research methodology, and publication guidance
- **09_Tools_and_Interactive_Demos** - Practical tools, code examples, and interactive demonstrations
- **10_Paper_Collections_and_Summaries** - Curated paper collections and research summaries

## Usage

Each folder contains:
- **README.md** - Overview of the topic area with key concepts and learning pathways
- **Papers/** - Collection of important research papers (where applicable)
- **Resources/** - Additional learning materials, tutorials, and references
- **Code/** - Implementation examples and practical demonstrations (where applicable)
