# Large Language Models and Transformers

This section focuses on transformer architectures, large language models, and natural language processing.

## Key Topics

- **Transformer Architecture**: Attention mechanisms, self-attention, multi-head attention
- **Large Language Models**: GPT series, BERT, T5, PaLM, ChatGPT
- **Training Techniques**: Pre-training, fine-tuning, instruction tuning, RLHF
- **Scaling Laws**: Model size, data requirements, compute efficiency
- **Emergent Abilities**: Few-shot learning, in-context learning, chain-of-thought reasoning
- **Applications**: Text generation, translation, summarization, question answering
