# Multi-Agent Learning

This section explores learning in multi-agent systems, coordination, and emergent behaviors.

## Key Topics

- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Agent coordination, communication, negotiation
- **Game Theory**: Nash equilibria, cooperative and competitive games
- **Emergent Behavior**: Swarm intelligence, collective decision making
- **Multi-Agent RL**: Independent learning, centralized training, decentralized execution
- **Social Learning**: Imitation, social influence, cultural evolution
- **Mechanism Design**: Auctions, voting systems, incentive alignment

## Research Areas

- Coordination and cooperation strategies
- Communication protocols and language emergence
- Scalability to large agent populations
- Learning in dynamic and heterogeneous environments
- Applications in robotics, economics, and social systems
- Theoretical analysis of multi-agent dynamics
